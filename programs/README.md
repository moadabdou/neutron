# Neutron Programs

This directory contains example programs written in the Neutron programming language.

## Available Programs

### 1. Quiz Game (`quiz.nt`)
A fun quiz game that tests your general knowledge with multiple choice questions.

### 2. Fibonacci Sequence Generator (`fibonacci.nt`)
Generates Fibonacci numbers up to a specified count. Due to the current limitations of the Neutron language (no loop constructs), this implementation supports up to 50 Fibonacci numbers using repeated if statements.

## Running Programs

To run any of these programs, use the Neutron interpreter:

```
./neutron programs/program_name.nt
```

For example:
```
./neutron programs/fibonacci.nt
```
