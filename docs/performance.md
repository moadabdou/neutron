# Neutron Compiler Performance

The Neutron compiler is built in C++ for maximum performance. Here are some basic benchmarks:

## Token Scanning Performance

Scanning a 1000-line Neutron file:

```
time ./neutronc large_file.nt

real    0m0.004s
user    0m0.003s
sys     0m0.001s
```

The scanner can process approximately 250,000 lines per second on a modern CPU.

## Memory Usage

The compiler is designed to be memory efficient:
- Small memory footprint (< 1MB)
- Minimal allocations during scanning
- Efficient token storage

## Comparison with Other Languages

| Language    | Compile Time (1000 lines) | Memory Usage |
|-------------|---------------------------|--------------|
| Neutron     | 0.004s                    | < 1MB        |
| Python      | N/A (interpreted)         | ~50MB        |
| JavaScript  | N/A (interpreted)         | ~100MB+      |

Note: These benchmarks are approximate and will vary based on system specifications and implementation details.
